  - Can be used internally or externally (private / public IP)
  - SSL Termination and processing (Layer 7 functionality)
      - ELB handles SSL processing
  - Cookie-based sticky session
      - User session routed to specific instance
  - Integrates w/ Auto Scaling
  - ELB EC2 health checks / Amazon CloudWatch  (advanced metric load balancing)
  - Integrates w/ Route 53  (Cloud based DNS load balancing )

Supported Ports:
    - 25 (SMTP)
    - 80 / 443 (HTTP / HTTPS)
    - 1024 - 65535

- Does not support EIP / public IP / only DNS

- Supports domain Zone Apex (can do pluralsight.com [without www.])

- Supports IPv4 and IPv6 (VPC does not support IPv6 yet)

- Integrates with CloudTrail for log security

- Multiple SSL certificates require multiple ELBs
    - Wildcard certificates are Supported (*.pluralsight.com)

DNS Based Load Balancing w/ Multiple ELB across Regions





##########################################################################
## VPC and Direct Connect
##########################################################################

Virutal Private Cloud Overview:
  - Logically isolated network in AWS cloud (master subnet)
  - Control of network architecture (create smaller subnets)
  - Enhanced security
      - via security groups
      - security groups applied to resources (EC2, ELBs)
      - Network Access Control Lists (NACL)
            - filter traffic at subnet level
  - Internetwork with other organizations (via VPC Peering)
      - connect two VPCs together
  - Elastic IP address (Public IP addr)
  - Enable hybrid cloud (site to site VPN)
  - Single tenant dedicated server hardware
  - VPC Cost = $0 / VPN = $0.05/hr

- Single Region Inter-VPC Routing
- Same or different AWS Accounts
- NO Transitive peering
- NO overlapping network addresses (different CIDR blocks)
- Default:  50 VPC peers per VPC / can request raise to 125

Private DNS entries cannot be resolved between VPC peers

Can update inbound / outbound rules for your VPC security groups to reference
security groups in the peered VPC.  (Can access resources in other VPC sec grp)

## NAT Instances and NAT Gateways
##########################################################################


NAT Gateway:   AWS Service / Amazon handles all details (High Availability / resiliancy)
NAT Instance:  Developer responsible for NAT functionality

Removing VPC NAT Bottlenecks:
  - Increase instance size
  - Choose instance that supports enhanced netowrking
  - Add NATs / subnets and migrate workloads (1 subnet - 1 NAT)

  HA for NAT is possible

  Subnet failover to another NAT is supported:
  https://aws.amazon.com/articles/2781451301784570
  https://aws.amazon.com/articles/high-availability-for-amazon-vpc-nat-instances-an-example/


## NAT Instances vs NAT Gateways

  ==============                          ==============
  - Use a script to manage failover       - Highly Available. NAT gateways in each
    between instances                       each AZ are implemented with redundancy

  - Depends on the bandwidth of the       - Supports bursts of up to 10Gbps
    instance type

  - Managed by you                        - Managed by AWS

  - A generic Amazon Linux AMI that's     - Software is optimized for handling NAT Traffic
    configured to perform NAT

  - Manual port forwarding                - Port forwarding is not supported

  - Use as a bastion server               - Bastion servers not supported

  - View CloudWatch alarms                - Traffic metrics not supported

                    CIDR: 192.168.1.0/24

2b. Create Subnet:  name: DB_subnet
                    VPC: XYZ_vpc
                    AZ: us-east-1c
                    CIDR: 192.168.2.0/24

3. Create Internet GW:  name: INET_gw
                        attach to VPC: XYZ_vpc

4. Create Route Table:  name: DMZ_rtbl
                        VPC: XYZ_vpc

5. Add Route:  destination: 0.0.0.0
               target: INET_gw

6. Add Subnet Assoc:  Edit
                       select DMZ_subnet

7. Create EC2 instance:  name: webserver
                         Network: XYZ_vpc
                         Subnet:  DMZ_subnet

                              TYPE: RDP

9. Create EC2 instance: > Community AMI >  "NAT > " amzn-ami-vpc-nat-hvm-*
                         Network: XYZ_vpc
                         Subnet:  DMZ_subnet
                         Auto assign Public IP:  ENABLE
                         name: NAT

Placement groups:  Logical grouping of instances in a single availability zone

Allows for low latency and high performance between instances by placing them
close together to each other.

 - Can't span multiple availability zones
 - Name must be unique across AWS account
 - Recommended for application that benefit from low latency, high bandwidth or both
 - Only supported instances that support enhanced networking that can be launched
   into a placement group (C3, C4, D2, I2, M4, E3)
 - Existing instances cannot be moved into a placement group
 - Placement groups cannot be merged
 - Can span peered VPCs but you will not get full bi-section bandwidth
   between instances
 - Reserved instances are supported on an instance level but you cannot explicitly
   reserver capacity for a placement group.


Placement Group Types:

  Cluster: clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone

  Spread:  spreads instances across underlying hardware

  Partition:  spreads instances across logical partitions, ensuring that
              instances in one partition do not share underlying hardware with
              instances in other partitions

## Storage and Archive

  - S3
  - EBS
  - Glacier
  - AWS Storage Gateway


## S3 Storage Classes:
    - S3 Standard
    - S3 Standard IA (Infrequent Access)
    - S3 RRS (Reduced Redundancy)

                        Standard      Standard-IA        RRS        Glacier

Facility loss tolerance  2              2                1           1

## S3 features:

  - Versioning  :  (Not on be default, once turned on you can't turn it off, only suspend)
  - Cross-region: replication (CRR)
  - Data lifecycle management  (move data between tiers i.e. RRS / Glacier)
  - MFA delete: (can't delete unless you give 2-factor code to delete)
  - Permissions: granular permissions to users and buckets
  - Time-limited access to objects.



## Optimizing for PUTs

  - Parallelization divides files into smaller parts and uploads them simultaneously
      Any part that fails is restarted without affecting rest of the file

  - Increase resiliency to network errors

  - Move the bottleneck to the network
  - file Chunk-size  25 - 50MB on high bandwidth networks
  - file Chunk-size  10 MB on low bandwidth netorks  - 50MB on high bandwidth networks

## Splitting Files:d
  - Windows:  http://www.hjsplit.org
  - Linux:    http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/split
  - Bucket Explorer:    http://www.bucketexplorer.com
  - CloudBerry S3 Explorer:   http://www.cloudberrylab.com/free-amazon-s3-explorer-cloudfront-IAM.aspx
  - S3 Explorer:   http://www.s3browser.com



## Optimizing for GETs

  - Use Cloudfront:
      - Multiple endpoints globally
      - Low latency endpoints
      - High transfer rates
      - Caches objects from S3
      - Reduces number of GETs

  - Two options of Cloudfront:
      - Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) distribution (Streaming files, media files)
      - Web distribution (static or dynamic content)


## Parallelizing for GETs
  - Use range-based GETs for multithreaded performance
  - Using the Range HTTP header in a GET request allows you to retrieve a
    specific range of bytes for an object stored in S3
  - Enables you to send multiple GETs at a time
  - Compensates for unreliable networks
  - Maxiximize bandwidth throughput


NOTE: Amazon S3 stores data lexicographically (Alphabetical Order)
    - Randomizing the name increases performance (Add a HEX hash string as a prefix)
    - Reverse the key name string
    - Only applies if you are processing 100 or more requests per second

ex.

NOTE:  will locate files close to each other
yourbucket/2016-18-03/march/photo1.jpg
yourbucket/2016-18-03/march/photo2.jpg
yourbucket/2016-18-03/march/photo3.jpg


## Added HEX Hash, spreads writes

yourbucket/791621/march/photo5.jpg
yourbucket/792621/march/photo6.jpg



## Securing Amazon S3

  - Bucket Policies: who can download, upload, delete, etc
  - MFA Delete
  - Backing up your bucket to another bucket in a different account


## Amazon EBS

  - Does not need to be attached to an instance
  - Cannot be attached to more than one instance at the same time
  - Can be transferred between Availability Zones
  - EBS volume data is replicated across multiple servers in an Availability Zone
  - Encryption of EBS data volumes, boot volumes, snapshots
  - Designed for an annual failure rate of 0.1% - 0.2% and SLA of 99.95%


## Amazon Glacier

  - up to 1000 vaults per account
  - individual archives can be from 1 byte to 40 TB
  - Integrates with Amazon S3 lifecycle policies

## Amazon Storage Gateway

  - Gateway-Cached Volumes:  retain local copy of most frequent data on premises,
                everything else moved to S3.
  - Gateway-Stored Volumes:  Low latency frequent access to data stored locally
                on storage gateway. Point in time snapshots are backed up to S3.
  - Gateway-Virtual Tape Library: Virtual tape library backed by S3 or Virtual
                tape shelf (backed by Glacier). Storage gateway exposes iSCSI
                interface to backup software.  For frequent access, use Virtual
                Tape Library.  Move Virtual Tape Library (on-premise) to
                Virtual Tape Shelf (off-premise).

##########################################################################
## AWS Database Services (RDS)
##########################################################################

## RDS Characteristics:
########################

  - Database engine managed by AWS
  - MySQL, Oracle,  Microsoft SQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Amazon Aurora
  - Multi-AZ Deployment options
  - Ideal for existing applications that rely on traditional
    relational database engines
  - Optimal for new applications with structured data that requires more
    sophisticated querying and joining capabilities
  - Amazon RDS for SQL Server supports Windows authentication
      - Using credentials stored in AWS directory Service for Microsoft Active
        Directory (Enterprise Edition)


## Non-ideal RDS Scenarios:
###########################

 Index & query focus data (DynamoDB)
 Numerous BLOBs (S3)
 Automated Scalability  (DynamoDB)
 Other database platforms (DB2 installed on EC2)
 Complete control (OS Level, utilize EC2 instance)


## Multi-AZ failover
###########################

 - Multi-AZ deployment designed for High Availability
 - Synchronous replica in secondary availability zone (master / slave )
 - Used for disaster recovery, NOT for scaling
 - Multi-AZ is different from an RDS read replica


## RDS Read Replicas
#####################

+------+            +------+
|      |            |      |
|  M   |  +-------+ |  R   |
|      |            |      |
+------+            +------+

  - Used for scaling out, not for disaster recover
  - Asynchronous replication / Read-only connections


## ACID
#####################

  - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
    properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably



## Dynamo DB
#####################

  - DynamoDB is fully managed, highly available and scalable NoSQL database
  - Automatically / Synchronously replicates data across three Availability Zones
  - SSDs and limiting indexing on attributes provides high throughput and low latency
  - ElastiCache can be sued in front of DynamoDB in order to offload hight
    amounts of reads for non-frequently changed data

  Ideal for:
    - flexible NoSQL db with low read / write latencies
    - Ability to scale storage and throughput up or down as needed without code
      changes or downtime.

  Use cases :
    - IoT
    - Gaming
    - Live voting
    - Mobile Apps
    - Digital Ad serving

  Non-Ideal for:
    - Prewritten application tied to a traditional relational db
    - Joins and/or complex transactions
    - BLOB data (S3 better)
    - Large data with low I/O rate

  DynamoDB Integration :
    - Amazon Elastic MapReduce
    - Amazon Redshift
    - Amazon Data Pipeline (automates data into/out of DynamoDB)
    - Amazon S3
    - Management Console and APIs


  DynamoDB Features :
    - Stores structured data in tables, indexed by a primary key
    - Tables are a collection of items and items are made up of attributes (columns)
    - Primary key can be:
        - Single attribute hash key
        - Composite hash-range key
    - Secondary index
    - Streams: keep track of item-level changes (or get list of all changes in last 24 hrs ??)
    - Cross-region Replication: replicate across regions / low latency access in multiple endpoints
    - Triggers: integrate with Lambda. Item event will cause a trigger
    - Schema-less:  flexible schema

    Two Ways to Search
        - Query Operation: finds items in a table using primary key attributes
        - Scan Operation : reads every item in a table or secondary index.
          Scan performance costly / query more efficient

Steps:
  1. User submits credentials to application
  2. Application sends credentials to Identity Broker (Trusted 3rd party software)
  3. Identity Broker validates credentials w/ Directory it is configured to
  4. Once credentials are validated/ credentials sent to Secure Token Service (STS)
  5. Once validated STS will issue: Access Key, Secure Access Key, Token and duration
  6. Identity Broker returns STS credentials back to application
  7. Application will utilize STS credentials to connect to S3
  8. S3 will confirm STS credentails against AWS IAM privileges
  9. IAM confirms back to S3 privileges users has

NOTE: STS service integrates with IAM

STS Service returns:
  - Access Key
  - Secret Access Key
  - Token
  - Duration (1 - 36 hrs)


## Cross Account Access
########################

Steps to setup Dev Access to Prod (need 2 aws accounts)

## On Dev Account
1. IAM > Groups > Create New Group >
              Group Name:  DevGrp

## AWS Security Strategies:  CloudTrail & CloudWatch
#############################################################################

## Cloud Trail
########################

CloudTrail:  A web service that records AWS API calls for your account and
delivers log files to you.  CloutTrail can log every API call on AWS.
Information recorded:
    - identity of the API caller
    - time of the API call
    - source IP address of the API call
    - The request parameters
    - The response elements returned by the AWS service

NOTE: NOT enabled by default.  Can be enabled per region.

CloudTrail logs calls from the following:
    - AWS Management Console
    - AWS SDKs
    - Command line tools
    - Higher-level AWS services (such as CloudFormation)

## Cloud Watch
########################

CloudWatch:  Monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and applications run on
AWS.  CloudWatch Logs can receive logs from CloutTrail and filter thru for
keywords etc. and create metrics against filters and take action.
CloudTrail does the following:
    - Collect and track metrics
    - Set Alarms
    - Collect and monitor log files
    - Automatically react to changes in your AWS resources

CloudWatch monitors:
    - Amazon EC2 instances
    - Amazon DynamoDB tables
    - Amazon RDS DB instances
    - Customer metrics generated by applications
    - Any log files applications generate

    - Gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization
    - Application performance
    - Operational health


CloudWatch Logs:
    - By default, CloudWatch will store log data indefinitely
    - Alarm history is stored for 14 days
    - CloudTrail logs can be sent to CloudWatch for real-time monitoring
    - CloudWatch metric filers can evaluate CloudTrail Logs for terms, phrases,
      and values.
    - Assign CloudWatch metric to filers

Storing Logs:
    - CloudWatch logs
    - Centralized logging system (Splunk)
    - Custom script and store on S3


Monitoring :
    - Do not store logs on non-persistent disks:
        - EC2 instances root volume
        - Ephemeral stoorage

    - Best Practice:  store logs in CloudWatch or S3

    - CloudTrail can be used across multiple AWS accounts while being pointed
      to a single S3 bucket (requires cross account access)

    - CloudWatch Logs subscription can be used across multiple AWS accounts
      (requires cross account access)

## AWS Security Strategies:  CloudHSM, DDoS and IDS / IPS
#############################################################################

Note:  CloudHSM = Cloud Hardware Security Module
       DDoS = Distributed Denial of Service
       IDS  = Instrusion Detection System
       IPS  = Instrusion Prevention System


## Cloud HSM
########################

Hardware Security Module (HSM): A physical computing device that safeguards and
manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides cryptoprocessing.

(Manages digital key and encrypts / decrypts continuously)

- HSMs can be used in any application that uses digial keys
- Used to protect high value keys
- HSM Uses:
    - Onboard secure cryptographic key generation
    - Onboard secure cryptographic key storage and management
    - Use of cryptographic and sensitive data material
    - Offloading application servers for complete asymmetric and symmetric
      cryptography.

    - HSM are deployed to manage Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) keys for databases
    - TDE automatically encrypts the data before it is written to the underlying
      storage device and decrypts when it is read from the storage device
    - Oracle requires key storage outside of KMS and integrates with CloudHSM
    - SQL Server requires a key but is managed by RDS after enabling TDE

CloudHSM Overview:
    - Secure key storage
    - Contractual and regulatory compliance
    - On-demand
    - Reliable and durable storage
    - Secure connectivity
    - Improved application performance
    - Integrated
    - Auditable

CloudHSM Details:
    - Single tenant
    - Deployed within VPC
    - VPC Peering is supported
    - Integrates with RDS (SQL and Oralce) and Redshift
    - EBS volume encryption, S3 Object encryption and key management are
      supported but require custom scripting
    - For HA and FT a cluster is required
    - Monitored via syslog



## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
#######################################

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): a type of denial of service attack where
multiple compromised systems are used to target a single system.

   - Reflection Attack: compromised servers overwhelm one server
   - Slow Loris Attack: packets sent slowly, server trying to handle slow packets
   - Amplification Attack:  Spoof IP address sends small request packet to
      service i.e. (DNS, NTP, SSDP, SNMP) and response is amplification of
      the initial request.   i.e.  64 byte to DNS, 3K response to target server

   - Flood, Reflection & Amplification Attack:  Attacker uses a botnet to
      send multiple amplifcation requests to DNS, etc. to flood a server.

Mitigation Techniques:

    - Minimize the attack surface, limit DMZ exposure
    - Scale to absorb the attack
    - Protect exposed resources (internet facing)
    - Learn normal behavior (monitor, etc.)
    - Create a plan for attacks


    Minimize the attack surface:
      - Reduce the number of necessary Internet entry points (minimize DMZ points)
      - Eliminate non-critical Internet entry points (move to private)
      - Separate end user traffic from management traffic (utilize bastion or jump server)
      - Obfuscate necessary Internet entry point to the level that untrusted
        end users cannot access them.
         (i.e. bastion server w/ white-listed IP addresses,  no DNS Names like rdp.example.com )
      - Decouple Internet entry points to minimize the effects of attacks
         i.e. remove single point of failure

    Scale to absorb the attack:
      - Design your infrastructure to scale out and scale up
        (autoscaling group, increase machine side)
      - Attackers have to expend more resources to scale up the attack
      - Attack is spread over a large area (i.e. use Cloudfront)
      - Scaling buys you time to analyze the attack and respond
      - Scaling provides you more redundancy

    Protect exposed resources:
      - CloudFront:  Geo Restriction, whitelist countries that can access
        and/or blacklist countries that cannot access.
      - CloudFront: Origin Access Identity (OAI): create a specific users to access AWS resources
        like S3. Direct access would be denied.
      - Route53: Alias Record Sets.  Alias can be redirected to a more capable ELB.
      - Route53: Private DNS.  Internal DNS names not accessible to Internet.
      - Web Application Firewall (WAF):  Level 7 firewall. Sits in front of EC2 instances
            WAF available as an Amazon Service

    Create a plan for attacks:
      - Validate the architecture and select the techniques that work for your
        infrastructure and application
      - Evaluate the costs for increased resiliency and understand the goals of your defense
      - Know who to contact when an attack happens

Reference Architecture Notes:

  - Public facing servcies: S3, CloudFront, Route 53
  - Admin traffic separate from users separate from internet
  - NAT handles Internet traffic that doesn't need an IP address
  - Users traffic goes thru CloudFront, ELB, AutoScaling group, WAF, ELB, Web Server, AutoScaling, MS SQL
  - Management traffic goes to Jump Server, then to EC2 instances
    (No CNAME, DNS for Jump Server!!!)




## Intrusion Detection / Prevention System

Intrusion Detection System (IDS):  An intrusion detection system (IDS) inspects
  all inbound and outbound network activity and identifies suspicious patterns
  that may indicate a network or system attack from someone attempting to break
  into or compromise a system.



Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):  An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is a
  network security / threat prevention technology that examines network
  traffic flows to detect and prevent vulnerability exploits.

#############################################################################
## Managing Billing Strategies :  EC2 Standard and Reserved Instances
#############################################################################


## EC2 Instance Types
##########################################
  - On-Demand  (highest cost)

  - Reserved (standard) - purchasing a reserved instance for a server
                          lower hourly rate for a time commitment (1yr etc.)

  - Reserved (scheduled)- purchase reserved instance during a specific schedule
                          i.e. end of month / end of quarter

  - Spot    - can bid on excess instances (hourly rate $1 hr vs $0.05)
              a higher bid can cause you to lose instances immediately

  - Dedicated (host)     - AWS dedicates a specific physical host
                         i.e. bring your own licenses / regulatory compliance
                         higher than On-Demand / Reserved or Spot

  - Dedicated (instance) - Dedicate type of server, don't get a specified physical host



## EC2 Instances In Depth
##########################################

On-demand:
  - Low cost and flexibility with no up front cost
  - Ideal for autoscaling groups and unpredictable workloads
  - Dev / Test (can throttle up/down when needed)


Reserved Instances:
  - Steady state and predictable usage
  - Applications that need reserved capacity
  - Upfront payments reduce hourly rate
  - Can have no / some / all upfront costs
  - Scheduled Reserver instances match your capacity reservation to a
    predictable recurring schedule

Spot:
  - Flexible start and end times
  - Grid Computing and HPC
  - Very low hourly compute cost

Dedicated:
  - Predictable performance
  - Complete isolation
  - Most expensive

## EC2 Instance Family
#######################

Family                  generation    Smallest      Largest
General Purpose (GP)      t2          t2.micro      t2.large

NOTE: M4 share same processor
      M3 share same processor


## Standard Reserved Instances Attributes
###########################################
Standard Reserved Instances: Requires commitment of 1 or 3 years

All upfront: paying costs all upfront
  - up to 68% discount over 3 year term

Partion upfront: paying costs all upfront
  - up to 60% discount over 3 year term

No upfront: paying costs all upfront
  - up to 30% discount over 1 year term


## Scheduled Reserved Instances Attributes
###########################################

  - Accrue charges hourly, billed in monthly increments over the term
    - Have a 1 year term commitment

Modifying Your RIs:
  - Switch Availabiilty Zones within the same region
  - Can change the instance size within instance type
  - Instance type modifications are supported only for Linux:
      - Due to licensing, RIs cannot be modified to Red Hat or SUSE
  - Cannot change instance size of Windows Reserved Instances

  Instance size         |   Normalization factor
  ----------------------|------------------------
      micro             |       0.5
      small             |        1
      medium            |        2
      large             |        4

      2xlarge           |        16
      4xlarge           |        32
      8xlarge           |        64
      10xlarge          |        80

2 Xlarge instances = 2 x 8 (norm factor) = 16
this is the same as
4 large instances  = 4 x 4 (norm factor) = 16
same as
8 medium instances = 8 x 2 (norm factor) = 16
same as
16 small instances = 16 x 1 (norm factor) = 16
same as
1 2xlarge instances = 1 x 16 (norm factor) = 16

Modification requests done via:
  - AWS Management Console
  - AWS CLI
  - Amazon EC2 API


## RDS Reserved Instances attributes
###########################################
  - DB Engine
  - DB Instance Class
  - Deployment type
  - License model
  - Region

NOTE:  Any changes to these attributes changes from RI to on-demand.
  - Can move between AZs in the same Region
  - Are available for Multi-AZ deployments
  - Can be applied to Read Replicas provided the DB Instance class and
    Region are the same.

Can link one paying account to several environment accounts and get consolidated
billing across accounts.

Advantages:
    - consolidated bills
    - paying accounts and linked accounts are independent and cannot access
      resources in other accounts
    - 20 linked accounts limit (can increase by contacing AWS)
    - Volume discounts (licensing)


Volume Discount example:
                        Standard
First 1 TB / month      $0.0300 / GB
Next 49 TB / month      $0.0295 / GB


Dev     750 GB    $22.5
Test    750 GB    $19.5
Prod   2500 GB    $72.25
LOB    3500 GB    $103.75
Total Storage 7.4 TB
Total Monthly without consolidated billing    $220
Total Monthly with    consolidated billing    $218.8

NOTE: Consolidated allows to hit tier discounts across accounts.




Volume discount example #2
  EC2 Family      Type                     Per Hr
  m4.Large        On-demand hourly          $0.246
  m4.Large        1 yr reserved instance    $0.184


Dev  - 3 on-demand instances                 $6464
Test - 2 on-demand instances                 $4309
Prod - 6 RI but only using 3 RI              $9671
LOB  - 10 RI but only using 8 Ri            $16118
---------------------------------------------------
Total yearly bill independent               $36562

Unused RIs = 5  ( if apply unused RIs across dev and test)
---------------------------------------------------
Total yearly bill with consolidated billing  $25789


## Paying Account
###########################################

Best Practices:
    - Use complex passwords
    - Use MFA
    - Do not deploy resources in paying account
    - Enable monitoring (billing alerts) on paying account consolidates
      billing data for all linked accounts.
    - You can still create billing alerts per account


## CloudTrail
###########################################

Enabled per account per region

You can consolidate all logs into a single S3 bucket:
  - Turn on CloudTrail in paying account
  - Create an S3 bucket policy that allows cross account access
  - Turn on CloudTrail in all other accounts
  - Configure all accounts to store logs in the paying account S3 bucket


## Resource Groups
###########################################

A resource group is a collection of resources that share one ore more tags or
portions of tags, and can be managed as a single group rather man move from
one AWS Service to another for each task.

  - Use a single page to view and manage your resources
  - Combines information about multiple resources, such as metrics, alarms and
    configuration details.
  - Create a custom console that organizes and consolidates the information you
    need based on your project and the resources you use.
  - Quickly identify resources that are not tagged
  - Can be shared among users in the same AWS account by sharing a URL
  - Users of the same AWS account can have different resource groups


Create resource group:

AWS > Create a Resource Group
[Create a Group]

Group Name:
Tags:
Regions:
Resource types:
                        [Save]

NOTE: To find untagged resources:  AWS > Tag Editor
Regions:
Resource Types:
Tags :
                        [find resources]
[Create a new tag key ]



#############################################################################
## Understanding CloudFormation, Elastic Beanstalk and OpsWorks
#############################################################################

## CloudFormation

Made of Templates and Stacks

    Templates
    ---------
  - Templates are architectural designs
  - Can create, update, delete templates
  - CloudFormation templates written in JSON

    Stacks
    ------
  - Stacks are deployed resources
  - Can create, update, delete stacks using templates

Templates:
  - Don't need to figure out the order for provisioning AWS services
  - Don't need to make dependencies work
  - Modify and updates templates in a controlled / predictable way
      - applying version control
  - Visualize template with AWS CloudFormation Designer (drag/drop)


Deploy Stacks:
  - AWS Management Console
  - CLI
  - API


## Template Elements

Mandatory:  file format and version
            list of resources and associated config values

Optional:   Template Parameters (limit of 60)
            Output values (limit of 60)
            List of data tables (static values: ami names, etc.)

# Intrinsic Functions
  Provides several built-in functions to manage stacks
    - Assign values to properties that are not available until runtime
          i.e.  IP Address, DNS Name

Sample Functions:
    - Fn::Base64
    - Condition Functions
    - Fn::FindInMap
    - Fn::GetAtt
    - Fn::GetAZs
    - Fn::Join
    - Fn::Select
    - Ref

Example:  Fn::GetAtt
  "Fn::GetAtt" : [ "logicalNameofResources", "attributeName"]
  ex.  "Fn::GetAtt" : [ "ELB", "DNSName"]
